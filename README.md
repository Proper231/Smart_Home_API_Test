# Smart_Home_API_Test
This is a repo for our capstone. This is a Smart home design based on a LLM and designed for elderly. We will update it as we work on it for capstone.

To run this code you will need to install some files. 
To get the credential.json file follow the steps at this link.
https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python

Once that is done, move the credential.json file to the LLM folder and run quikcstart.py to get the token.json file.
